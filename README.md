Simple Christmas Resource for QBCore
- Spawn Christmas tress
- Collect gifts from trees
- Random chance to get coal
- Trees are server synced by citizenids. You can only use each tree once every server restart
- `QBCore.Functions.AddItems()` is used for the two items, no need to add items to your core shared items when using this script.

Happy Holidays from the Redline Studios Team!
